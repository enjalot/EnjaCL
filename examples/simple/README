Simple example using the enjaCL library to move some particles around in OpenCL

This example uses the minimum possible functionality of the library, not even OpenGL.

To run:
mkdir build
ln -s ../.. enjacl      #this step is a hack until I figure out a proper FindEnjaCL.cmake
cd build
cmake ..
make


The CMake is a little hacky, it adds the library as a subdirectory. I figure
for now you could just copy the enjacl folder for your own project and do the
same. The real way to do it involves making a FindEnjaCL.cmake which will find
the installed enjacl library (which means I also need to think about
installers!)
